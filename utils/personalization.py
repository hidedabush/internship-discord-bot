"""Per-member personalized match scoring for the premium tier.

utils/relevance.py scores a posting once for the whole server. This scores it
again per premium member against their own short interest blurb (set via
/set_profile), so the personalized DM digest can surface only what's actually
relevant to *that* person instead of just the server-wide ranking.

Same fail-open contract as utils/relevance.py: if Ollama is unreachable or
returns something unusable, callers get a neutral score back rather than an
exception — a flaky LLM call should never crash a scan or block the digest.
